    "RESULTS": {
      "original": "The authors in [1] identify two distinct gate oxide failure mechanisms associated with deep trench processes: (1) gate oxide breakdown due to quantum tunneling current and (2) gate oxide degradation caused by hot carrier injection. The quantum tunneling current arises from the ability of electrons to tunnel through the gate oxide, leading to an unwanted flow of charge and degradation of the gate insulator. The hot carrier injection occurs when high-energy carriers are injected into the gate oxide, causing damage and degradation.",
