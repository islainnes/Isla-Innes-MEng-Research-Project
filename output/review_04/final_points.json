  "RESULTS": [
    "1. In the first paragraph, the authors switch from discussing the benefits of deep trenches for gate oxide yield to discussing the increased thickness and improved uniformity of the gate oxide in deep trench processes. It would be helpful to clarify the relationship between these concepts and ensure that the ideas are presented in a logical order.",
    "2. In the second paragraph, the authors discuss the potential applications of spin control in quantum computing, but it is not clear how these applications relate to the previous discussion of spin control in semiconductors. It would be helpful to provide some context or connection between the two topics.",
    "3. In the first paragraph, the authors mention the probability of gate oxide breakdown and gate oxide charge injection, but it is not clear what these terms mean or how they relate to gate oxide yield. It would be helpful to define these terms or provide some context for their use."
