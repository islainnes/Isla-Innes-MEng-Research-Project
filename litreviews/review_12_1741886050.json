    "INTRODUCTION": "Artificial Intelligence (AI) is increasingly being integrated into various systems, including embedded systems, to enhance their functionality and performance. Embedded systems are computer systems that are designed to perform specific tasks within a larger system. Integrating AI into embedded systems presents unique challenges due to the limited resources and real-time requirements of these systems. In this report, we will explore the challenges and potential solutions for integrating AI into embedded systems, drawing insights from the papers \"Exploring Explainable AI Techniques for Radio Frequency Machine Learning\" [1] and \"Design Digital Data Acquisition and Processing Systems for Embedded Systems\" [2].",
    "METHODOLOGY": "The first paper, \"Exploring Explainable AI Techniques for Radio Frequency Machine Learning,\" proposes the use of explainable AI techniques for machine learning models in radio frequency systems [1]. The authors focus on the challenges of integrating AI into radio frequency systems, specifically in the context of machine learning models. They propose techniques to improve the explainability of these models, which is crucial for understanding and trusting the decisions made by the AI.\n\nThe second paper, \"Design Digital Data Acquisition and Processing Systems for Embedded Systems,\" discusses the design of digital data acquisition and processing systems for embedded systems [2]. The authors present the architecture of two systems and discuss their advantages and problems. This paper does not directly address the integration of AI into embedded systems but provides valuable insights into the design of digital processing systems that can support AI applications.",
    "RESULTS": "The paper \"Exploring Explainable AI Techniques for Radio Frequency Machine Learning\" discusses the challenges of integrating AI into radio frequency systems, specifically in the context of machine learning models [1]. The authors identify several challenges, including the limited computational resources, real-time requirements, and the need for explainability. To address these challenges, they propose techniques such as model compression, quantization, and explainable AI methods.\n\nModel compression techniques, such as pruning and quantization, can reduce the computational requirements of machine learning models, making them suitable for embedded systems [1]. Real-time requirements can be met by using techniques such as online learning and incremental learning, which allow models to be updated in real-time [1]. Explainability is crucial for understanding and trusting the decisions made by the AI, and the authors propose techniques such as LIME (Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations) and SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) to improve the explainability of machine learning models [1].\n\nThe paper \"Design Digital Data Acquisition and Processing Systems for Embedded Systems\" presents the architecture of two digital data acquisition and processing systems and discusses their advantages and problems [2]. The authors emphasize the importance of designing efficient and flexible systems that can support various applications, including AI applications [2]. The first system, based on a microcontroller, offers low power consumption and flexibility but has limited processing capabilities [2]. The second system, based on a field-programmable gate array (FPGA), offers high processing capabilities but requires more power and resources [2].",
    "DISCUSSION": "The integration of AI into embedded systems presents unique challenges due to the limited resources and real-time requirements of these systems [1][2]. Techniques such as model compression, quantization, and online learning can help address these challenges by reducing computational requirements, meeting real-time requirements, and improving explainability [1]. However, these techniques may come at the cost of increased power consumption or design complexity [2].\n\nThe paper \"Design Digital Data Acquisition and Processing Systems for Embedded Systems\" provides valuable insights into the design of digital processing systems that can support AI applications [2].
