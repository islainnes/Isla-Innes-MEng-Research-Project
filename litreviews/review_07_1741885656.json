    "INTRODUCTION": "The semiconductor industry is constantly pushing the boundaries of technology to create smaller, more efficient, and more powerful electronic devices. One material that has gained significant attention for its potential to enhance electronic device performance is graphene [1]. Graphene, a single layer of carbon atoms arranged in a two-dimensional honeycomb lattice, offers unique electrical, thermal, and mechanical properties that make it an attractive alternative to traditional silicon-based materials [2]. However, integrating graphene into Complementary Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor (CMOS) technology remains a challenge. In this report, we will discuss the current state of research on integrating graphene into CMOS technology, focusing on the papers provided [1-3].",
    "METHODOLOGY": "The first paper, \"Sustainability model for semiconductor manufacturing,\" discusses the challenges of sustainability in the semiconductor industry and proposes a sustainability model for manufacturing [1]. Although the paper does not directly address the integration of graphene into CMOS technology, it provides valuable insights into the current state of semiconductor manufacturing and the potential benefits of using alternative materials like graphene.\n\nThe second paper, \"High-Temperature SiC Power Module with Integrated SiC Gate Drivers for Future High-Density Power Electronics Applications,\" focuses on the development of a high-temperature silicon carbide (SiC) power module with integrated SiC gate drivers [2]. The paper discusses the potential benefits of using SiC in power electronics applications and the challenges of integrating SiC gate drivers. Although the paper does not specifically mention graphene, it provides valuable context for understanding the challenges of integrating new materials into power electronics.\n\nThe third paper, \"Gate Oxide Yield Improvement for 0.18um Power Semiconductor Devices with Deep Trenches,\" discusses the challenges of gate oxide yield improvement in deep trench processes for 0.18um power semiconductor devices [3]. The paper does not mention graphene but provides valuable insights into the challenges of integrating new materials into existing semiconductor processes.",
    "RESULTS": "The papers do not provide specific results on the integration of graphene into CMOS technology. Instead, they discuss the challenges and potential benefits of using alternative materials like SiC and the difficulties of integrating new materials into existing semiconductor processes.",
    "DISCUSSION": "The papers highlight the challenges of integrating new materials like graphene and SiC into CMOS technology. The sustainability paper discusses the need for a sustainability model to address the challenges of increasing foundry size and wafer fabrication complexity [1]. The SiC power module paper discusses the challenges of integrating SiC gate drivers into power electronics applications [2]. The gate oxide yield improvement paper discusses the challenges of integrating new materials into existing semiconductor processes [3].\n\nDespite the challenges, the papers also suggest potential benefits of using alternative materials like graphene and SiC in semiconductor technology. The sustainability paper discusses the potential environmental benefits of using alternative materials [1]. The SiC power module paper discusses the potential benefits of using SiC in power electronics applications, such as increased power density and efficiency [2].",
    "CONCLUSION": "The papers provide valuable insights into the challenges and potential benefits of integrating new materials like graphene and SiC into CMOS technology. However, they do not provide specific results on the integration of graphene into CMOS technology. Further research is needed to address the challenges of integrating graphene into CMOS technology and to fully realize its potential benefits.",
