    "INTRODUCTION": "Radio-frequency identification (RFID) technology and the Internet of Things (IoT) are two emerging technologies that have gained significant attention in recent years. RFID technology enables automatic identification and tracking of objects or items using radio waves [1]. On the other hand, IoT refers to the network of interconnected physical devices, vehicles, buildings, and other items that are embedded with sensors, software, and network connectivity, allowing them to collect and exchange data [2]. The integration of RFID technology into IoT devices presents numerous challenges and opportunities. This report provides a literature review on the challenges and potential solutions for integrating RFID technology into IoT devices based on the following papers: \"Development of Data Communication System with Ultra High Frequency Radio Wave for Implantable Artificial Hearts\" [1], \"Exploring Explainable AI Techniques for Radio Frequency Machine Learning\" [2], and \"Spreading seamless Radio over IP Services in Tactical Public Safety Communications using PTP Microwave IP Radio Networks\" [3].",
    "METHODOLOGY": "The first paper, \"Development of Data Communication System with Ultra High Frequency Radio Wave for Implantable Artificial Hearts,\" discusses the development of a data communication system using ultra-high frequency (UHF) radio waves for implantable artificial hearts [1]. The authors used UHF RFID technology to enable real-time monitoring and control of the implantable artificial heart. The system consisted of a reader, a transmitter, and an implantable receiver. The reader and transmitter were used to send commands and receive data, while the implantable receiver transmitted data to the reader.\n\nThe second paper, \"Exploring Explainable AI Techniques for Radio Frequency Machine Learning,\" focuses on the application of explainable AI techniques for radio frequency machine learning [2]. The authors used RFID technology to collect data for machine learning models and explored the use of explainable AI techniques to improve the transparency and interpretability of the models.\n\nThe third paper, \"Spreading seamless Radio over IP Services in Tactical Public Safety Communications using PTP Microwave IP Radio Networks,\" discusses the use of PTP microwave IP radio networks to provide seamless radio over IP services in tactical public safety communications [3]. The authors used RFID technology to enable automatic identification and tracking of emergency vehicles and resources.",
    "RESULTS": "The paper on the development of a data communication system for implantable artificial hearts using UHF RFID technology demonstrated the feasibility of real-time monitoring and control of implantable devices [1]. The system was able to transmit data at a rate of 115.2 kbps, which was sufficient for monitoring vital signs and controlling the artificial heart.\n\nThe paper on exploring explainable AI techniques for radio frequency machine learning showed that explainable AI techniques can improve the transparency and interpretability of machine learning models [2]. The authors used RFID technology to collect data from various sources and applied explainable AI techniques to improve the performance and explainability of the models.\n\nThe paper on spreading seamless radio over IP services in tactical public safety communications using PTP microwave IP radio networks demonstrated the potential of using RFID technology for automatic identification and tracking of emergency vehicles and resources [3]. The authors were able to achieve seamless communication between different VHF, UHF, and HF wireless radio technologies using PTP microwave IP radio networks.",
    "DISCUSSION": "The integration of RFID technology into IoT devices presents several challenges, including data security, data privacy, and interoperability between different RFID technologies and IoT platforms [1, 2, 3]. The papers reviewed in this literature review provide insights into potential solutions for these challenges.\n\nThe paper on the development of a data communication system for implantable artificial hearts using UHF RFID technology highlighted the importance of data security and privacy in RFID applications [1]. The authors used encryption techniques to secure the data transmitted between the reader and the implantable receiver.\n\nThe paper on exploring explainable AI techniques for radio frequency machine learning emphasized the need for interoperability between different RFID technologies and IoT platforms [2]. The authors used standardized communication protocols to enable interoperability between different RFID technologies and machine learning models.\n\nThe paper on spreading seamless radio over IP services in tactical public safety communications using PTP microwave IP radio networks discussed the importance of ensuring seamless communication between different wireless radio technologies [3]. The authors used PTP microwave IP radio networks    to provide a unified communication infrastructure for different VHF, UHF, and HF radio technologies.",
    "CONCLUSION": "In conclusion, the integration of RFID technology into IoT devices presents several challenges, including data security, data privacy, and interoperability.
