## I Introduction

We have recently encountered a serious lack of radio frequency resources with the rapid deployment and world wide expansion of wireless communication systems such as cellular phones, especially those less than 6 GHz because they are suitable and heavily utilized typically by cellular or mobile communication systems.

Under such circumstances, in order to ensure the frequency resources for vital mobile communications, it is necessary to carry out cutting-edge technical research and development (R & D) to enable the effective and efficient usage of limited frequency resources. One approach to achieve efficient use of frequency resources is to allow secondary system(s) to utilize those frequency allocations, such as the well-known TV white space, when they are not used by the primary system(s). Our approach to achieve the efficient use of frequency resources cooperatively utilize the radio resources of multiple co-existing different communication schemes in some frequency bands, which is generally called heterogeneous radio communication. Different radio communication schemes in different radio environments may have different radio link quality such as reliability. Therefore, by cooperative selection of different communication schemes offered in certain areas, higher reliability and efficiency is achieved than those served by a single communication scheme.

We have performed R & D on the Cognitive Radio System (CRS) [1] under contract organized by the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications (MIC) of Japan since 2005 and have developed some techniques for efficient use of radio spectrum resources [2-7].

As the advanced activities of the CRS R &D, we have been successively engaged in new R & D project concerning cooperative heterogeneous radio networks for reliability improvements [8], also under contract organized by the MIC in Japan. In this project, we are focusing on the simultaneous improvement of the link reliability and spectrum efficiency by means of cooperative heterogeneous wireless networks, which select one or more among different communication schemes in some frequency bands on the basis of the advanced sensing of the surrounding radio environments.

Herein, our project overview is described in Section II. In Section III, as an output of this project in the first year, developed test-bed and its key features are introduced. After some experimental results in Section IV, conclusions are finally stated in Section V.

## II Project Overview for Heterogeneous Wireless Networks

### _Project Objective_

The target of our project is to establish key technologies realizing both of efficient spectrum use and reliable radio link. Improvement of the reliability usually costs some resources such as transmit power and/or spectrum. However, in heterogeneous wireless networks, we think the improvement of the link reliability can coexist with that of efficient spectrum usage. For example, when users who can access multiple radio networks select less crowded or stronger radio network for their communications, spectrum is more efficiently used than in the case of single radio network. In other words, traffic load is balanced among multiple access networks, which leads to the efficient spectrum use. Then we have a degree-of-freedom to decide which users use which radio access networks for the load-balancing. The reliability performance is the criteria for that decision. By cooperative multiple radio networks, this research aims at the comparable reliability performance to wired communications, together with the characteristics of importance and urgency.

Furthermore, as a future target, we will evaluate the reliability as a function of the attainability of data packets and the time probability of user satisfaction of the radio link quality of service. Concerning such evaluation characteristics, we have so far the following final objectives at the end of project.

* Reliability: by cooperating \(N\) communication systems, to improve the attainability of packet arrival by more than _N_-th multiple, which has the necessity of urgent transmission, compared with the case of a single communication scheme,
* Frequency use efficiency: by cooperating \(N\) communication systems, to reduce the outage time probability of service by less than 1/_N_-th multiple, compared with the case of a single communication scheme.

### _Concept of the Heterogeneous Wireless Networks and Research Items_

Figure 1 shows a concept of the heterogeneous wireless networks. There are three different wireless communication systems, or radio access networks (RAN), RAN1, RAN2 and RAN3 co-exist, for instance. The user terminal can monitor and access those three RANs. The RAN itself also monitors the radio environmental condition such as signal strength or traffic congestion. Such information collected both at terminal and base station sides are gathered at the resource managers which select a RAN to be used among the three RANs. There are three research issues as follows.

#### Ii-B1 Quality control technique of cooperative heterogeneous wireless networks

To precisely control the link quality of heterogeneous radio systems, we will study the following:

* Advanced sensing techniques to acquire status of the surrounding unstable radio environment, which varies time to time,
* Integrated radio resource controlling techniques to enhance service reliability by cooperating the scheduler schemes of each communication system.

#### Ii-B2 Asymmetric link configuration technique of cooperative heterogeneous radio networks

Supposing asymmetric configuration of the communication link and traffic flow in the up- and down-link, we will investigate the following:

* Advanced technique of radio resource utilization by treating the transmitting and receiving links separately.

#### Ii-B3 Cross layer coordination technique of cooperative heterogeneous radio networks

Considering a variety of application features, we will study the following:

* Technique to offer the radio quality appropriate to each feature of the application, by means of the cooperation of the upper and lower layers, in which information of the radio environments is conveyed to the application layer.

### _Project Schedule_

Our R & D project has a four-year plan. As the first year in the 2008 fiscal year, basic study of the network architecture, controlling sequence and configuration of resource manager and so forth have been performed and manufactured a test-bed for this project which is shown in later part of this paper. In fiscal year of 2009, basic evaluation of the controlling scheme of the link quality, sensing scheme of radio environment, asymmetric communication link and so forth has been researched. Finally, in 2011 fiscal year, we will manufacture a trial system of totalized cooperative heterogeneous wireless networks and its evaluation system, and conduct a field trial of the systems which may include the facilities developed in other research organizations.

## III Trial Manufacturing of a Test-bed

### _Key Features_

The studies for the above three research issues obtained so far are described as follows. Based on the study results, we have been proceeding with trial manufacturing of three different systems of communication equipment including the LTE, WiMAX and WiFi, shown in Figure 2. Herein, the LTE, WiMAX and WiFi correspond to RAN1, RAN2 and RAN3 in Figure 1, respectively.

#### Iii-A1 Quality control technique of cooperative heterogeneous radio networks

We obtained the following study results:

* Architecture to cooperatively and equally control heterogeneous radio systems,
* Unified data format exchanging between the database for radio system selection and the RMC (RAN Measurement Collector),
* Refreshment of data base that is triggered by the acquisition of new IP data so as to avoid the issue of unnecessary query to the Data Base.

#### Iii-A2 Asymmetric link configuration technique of cooperative heterogeneous radio networks

For the purpose of providing the best uplink and downlink simultaneously, symmetric configuration with regard to the resource manager has been adopted both at the network side and the user side, which realizes independent RAN selection for uplink and downlink.

#### Iii-A3 Cross layer coordination technique of cooperative heterogeneous radio networks

For a quicker information acquisition for system selection from the application server, we adopted

* A database configuration obtaining such information in session level.

### _Outline of test-bed_

In Figure 2, the name of the functional block follows the definition standardized in IEEE P1900.4 [9]. The test-bed is schematically composed of controlling equipment and radio communication equipment. The main functions of each block are listed in TABLE I. Basically, the hardware of the test-bed is comprised of modified one of commercially available equipment and the main software is developed for this project.

### _Controlling rack_

The schematic block diagram and its specification of the controlling equipment are included in Figure 2 and TABLE I, respectively. Figure 3 shows a photograph of the controlling equipment.

From the RMC of each radio module, the information for the communication scheme selection is exported to the DB for Radio Module Selector in a short period in the order of 1 second around, in the unified format of surrounding radio circumstance. The Module Selector will select the prior radio module based on the internal radio circumstance data registered to the DB by NRM and TRM, which is frequently updated.

The Module Selector will delete the entry of the internal data table, unless the IP data is received within the predetermined time, thus the issue of the unnecessary query to the DB is avoided. The NRM has the function of monitoring the whole heterogeneous network operation of the test-bed.

As for the control scheme, we studied various possibilities. One of them is the utilization of the time occupancy ratio in each radio system. In this scheme, the terminal will measure the time occupancy ratio or receive it from the base station, then the selection of the radio system is carried out using predetermined rules [10].

## V Conclusions

This paper introduces our research activities on heterogeneous wireless networks. The target of the research is to improve the link reliability and the spectrum efficiency simultaneously by cooperative multiple radio networks. In first year of the project, an architecture of the heterogeneous networks was studied with three research issues and a test-bed system was developed. We also confirmed the fundamental behavior of the system. As a next step, we are investigating problematic or expandable issues in our first year results to take a further step toward our target.
