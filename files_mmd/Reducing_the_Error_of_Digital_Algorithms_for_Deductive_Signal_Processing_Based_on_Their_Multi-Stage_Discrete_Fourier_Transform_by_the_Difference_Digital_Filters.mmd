###### Abstract

The issues of using digital methods of discrete Fourier transform of polyharmonic signals for their deductive processing by elementary devices of nanoelectronics or programmable logic devices are considered. Deductive processing of digital signals is performed on the basis of their discrete Fourier transform by adding and shifting time samples of these signals. Their digital difference filtering with integer difference coefficients provides such a discrete Fourier transform without performing multiplication operations. Unerroric of deductive processing of polyharmonic signals based on their discrete Fourier transform, which does not require multiplication operations, will reduce the error of such processing on elementary nanoelectronics devices and programmable logic devices.

## I Introduction

The constant development of the nanoelectronics element base stimulates the advanced development of computational algorithms for converting digital signals by its elementary devices [1]. In some cases, when building these algorithms, you can use digital signal processing (DSP) methods on universal or specialized processors and programmable logic devices (PLD) [2-4]. Moreover, the limited hardware implementation capabilities of fast matrix multipliers make it necessary to develop new DSP algorithms without performing multiplication operations.

Deductive digital signals processing (DDSP) of based on their multi-stage discrete Fourier transform (MDFT) using digital difference filters (DDF) provides DSP only with addition and shift operations. The concept of DDSP means their recurrent representation and transformation by finite difference methods [5]. However, the triviality of elementary nanoelectronics devices actualizes the search for a solution to the problem of reducing the error of software and hardware implementation of MDFT computational algorithms for digital signals based on their non-recursive difference digital filtering [6]. And the integer value of the difference coefficients of DDF allows you to reduce hardware costs for PLD implementation of computational algorithms of DSP, since it provides an DDSP based on MDFT using the DDF without performing multiplication operations [5-9].

The effect of quantization of the difference coefficients of the DDF has a strong influence on the accuracy of digital filtering, and, consequently, on the error of the DDSP based on the MDFT using DDF. To reduce the error of this treatment and its unerroric. The concept of "unerroric" (from the Latin "errare") means the combined application of methods and procedures to reduce the error of methods and algorithms for processing information. The term "unerroric" in relation to DDSP based on MDFT refers to the active process of reducing error rate radio when differential is selected, the coefficients for DDF [10].

## II Purpose and Methods

The purpose of this report is to define and formalize the necessary and sufficient condition for reducing the error of DDSP based on MDFT using DDF. To achieve this goal, we used methods of directional search and comparative analysis of the parameters and results of MDFT based on differential digital filtering of different orders of difference.

## III Theoretical Basis

The theoretical basis for unerroric of DDSP on the basis of their MDFT is the method of finite differences to replace the \(n\)-th time samples \(x(n\cdot T)\) digital signal with sampling period \(T\) to their \(n\)-s and increments of \(l\)-th order \(x_{0}(l\),\(n\cdot T)\) by the formula (1) for \(n\)=0,1,2...\(N\)-1, \(n\)=0,1,2...\(N\)+\(l\)-1, \(l\)=1,2,3...\(L\), and \(k\)-s coefficients \(h^{n}(k)\) digital filtering of \(K\)-th order \(k_{0}\)=\(k\) differential coefficients \(h_{0}(M,k_{0})\) digital differential filter of the \(K\)+\(M\)-th order and \(M\)-th order difference for \(k\)=0,1,2...\(K\)-1 and \(k_{M}\) -0,1,2... \(K\)+\(M\)-1, as shown in figure 1 [6-9]:

\[x(n\cdot T)=\sum_{n_{0}=0}^{n}\sum_{n_{1}=0}^{n_{0}}...\sum_{n_{1}=0}^{n_{L}}...\sum_{n_{L}=0}^{n_{L}}\sum_{n_{L}=0}^{n_{L}}x_{p_{0}}(L,n_{L}\cdot T). \tag{1}\]

This replacement allows the algorithm \(J\)-point MDFT performing convolution \(k\)-th coefficients of the filter \(h^{n}(j\),\(k)\) and \(n\)-th time samples \(x(n\cdot T)\) via the canonical formula digitalfiltering with finite impulse response by successive summation of low-bit \(k_{M}\) -th differential coefficients of \(M\)-th order difference \(h_{\text{p}}(J,M,k_{\text{u}})\) and low-bit \(n_{\text{r}}\) increments \(L\)-th order \(x_{\text{p}}(L,n_{\text{r}}\mathcal{T})\) for \(j\)=1,2,3...,\(J\), \(k\)=0,1,2...\(K\)-1, \(k_{M}\)=0,1,2...\(K\)-M-1, \(n_{\text{r}}\)=0,1,2...\(K\)-1 and \(n_{\text{r}}\)=0,1,2...\(N\)+\(L\)-1 [5-6]. The MDFT algorithm has a pyramid-type structure. The pyramid structure of the MDFT algorithm is a sequence of DSP stages, each of which consists of computational procedures for dividing the spectrum of a digital signal into bands using the methods CORDIC (Coordinate Rotation Digital Compute) and difference digital filtering of time samples of this signal [9]. At the first stage, the digital signal spectrum is divided into three bands. At each subsequent stage, the number of band spectra is three times greater than at the previous stage. The multi-stage structure of the MDFT algorithm allows adapting it to changes in time in the frequency resolution of the digital signal spectrum, which makes it possible to improve the quality of DDSP by significantly reducing hardware costs when implementing DDF on PLD [4-6].

## IV Practical Significance and Novelty

The practical significance of the research is to determine the necessary and sufficient conditions for reducing the error of DDSP based on MDFT using DDF, when their hardware and software implementation on elementarynanoelectronics devices and on PLD.

The novelty of the research results lies in the formalization of this condition. The reliability of the research results is confirmed by their compliance with the results of well-known developments of digital signal processing methods.

## V Theoretical Background of the Research

MDFT has a pyramidal structure that ensures the recurrence of spectral analysis of a polyharmonic digital signal at all stages of such a Fourier transform. It is an alternation of computational algorithms of CORDIC and difference digital filtering. Using DDF with integer difference coefficients of digital filtering allows replacing each multiplication operation in the MDFT algorithm with a set of addition and shift operations [6,8-9].

DDF can and should improve the quality of MDFT-based DDSP by reducing the error of such differential digital filtering with integer difference coefficients. This error is determined only by the effects of rounding the processed numbers in case of possible register overflows during multiple addition operations. In addition, the effect of quantization of the coefficients of such digital filtering has a strong influence on its accuracy [10].

Therefore, to reduce the error of DDSP based on MDFT using DDF, it is necessary and sufficient to determine the acceptable ratios of the values of the orders of its DDF and the orders of their difference [6, 10]. Moreover, errors in rounding the results of arithmetic operations on digital signal counts are similar to the noise of quantization of this signal. But the theoretical analysis of the total noise due to quantization effects is always very difficult, since there are many sources of rounding noise, since they are all located in different parts of the software or hardware implementation of MDFT algorithm [10].

Thus, it is unlikely that a General analysis of the value of the DDSP error, which is caused by quantization effects and depends on the structure of the computational algorithm and the way numbers are represented in digital computing devices, is possible. At the same time, reducing the error of DDSP based on MDFT using DDF when developing its computational algorithms for integer DDF difference coefficients can and should provide uncorricor of such processing by methods of comparative analysis and directed iteration of MDFT results using these DDF of different orders at different orders of difference in order to reduce hardware costs for software and hardware implementation of computational algorithms based on such MDFT.
