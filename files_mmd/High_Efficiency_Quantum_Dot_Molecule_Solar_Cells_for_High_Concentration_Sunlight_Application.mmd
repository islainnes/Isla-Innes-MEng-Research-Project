###### Abstract

InAs quantum dot molecule (QDM) solar cells are fabricated by modified molecular beam epitaxy technique. With multi-stacks and high dot density greater than 10\({}^{12}\) cm\({}^{-2}\), a QDM solar cell with hetero-structure provides high conversion efficiency of 25.9 % under 100 mW/cm\({}^{2}\) AM solar simulator. The improved efficiency of this novel nanostructure solar cell is due to the extension of solar response to long wavelength region beyond the band edge of GaAs, which is used as the substrate for the hetero-structure of AlGaAs/GaAs having InAs quantum dot molecules as the active part of the solar cells. It is also found that QDM solar cells perform better at high concentration sunlight due to the low dimensionality of quantum dot structure.

 InAs Quantum Dot Molecule Solar Cells / High Concentrator Solar Cells

## I Introduction

The limitation of energy conversion efficiency of conventional solar cells is defined by the band gap of semiconductor which absorbs the solar spectrum. Many research groups try to make use of multi-junction solar cells having tandem structure for better conversion efficiency. However, the tandem structure is complicated in terms of fabrication because of lattice mismatching among different semiconductors and a need for good tunnel junctions between upper and lower cells. The original idea of our work is to make use of the nanostructure in single hetero-junction solar cells which is simple in terms of engineering design and fabrication. Quantum dot is a zero dimensional nanostructure which could be self assembled by a strain relaxation of lattice mismatch between different semiconductors like InAs/GaAs, having 7% lattice mismatch. The electrical and optical properties of quantum dots are superior due to their defects-free crystallographic structure. This leads to the idea of quantum dot solar cells for high-efficiency energy conversion. However, one of the technical barriers is how to fabricate high dot density and large dot volume for significant solar absorption. In this paper, we demonstrate a technique which can be used to achieve those requirements by preparing quantum dot molecules (QDMs) with have high dot density, good dot uniformity, and dot alignment.

Multi-stack of InAs QDMs are inserted into a AlGaAs/GaAs heterostructure solar cells and characterized by current-voltage spectral response measurement. As predicted, QDM solar cells have higher efficiency than heterostructure solar cells, the latter are without quantum dot integration and serve as controlled samples. The energy conversion efficiency of QDM solar cells is found to be as high as 25.9 % without any optimization of the cell structure. The spectrum response beyond the absorption edge of GaAs greater than 850 nm wavelength is also measured and this is an evidence of output contribution from quantum dot molecules for better solar cell performance.

I-V characteristics of QDM solar cells at high concentration sunlight are also investigated by using focused illumination from solar simulator up to 4 sums. It is interesting result when we found that the output of QDM solar cell and, in particular, the short-circuit current density is linearly increased with light intensity comparing to that of conventional hetero-junction solar cell without QDM integration, which is slightly decreased due to scattering loss of the photo-carriers at high concentration sunlight. We believe that the quantum nature of QDMs is the key improvement of their photovoltaic performance at high solar intensity. This high efficiency QDM solar cell operating at high sun number would lead to an alternative design of photovoltaic concentrator system at lower cost for terrestrial applications in the next decades. Small-area QDM solar cells having high power-to-weight ratio also have potentials for space and military applications.

## II Fabrication of Quantum Dot Molecule Solar Cells

Quantum dot molecules (QDMs) are modified nanostructures grown by thin-capping-and-regrowth molecular beam epitaxial (MBE) process [1]. They are laterally close-packed InAs quantum dots (QDs) having high dot density of 10\({}^{10}\)-10\({}^{11}\) cm\({}^{-2}\) (see figure 1). With repeated MBE growth process, high density QDMs having dot density up to 10\({}^{12}\) cm\({}^{2}\) are achieved (see figure 2). We insert multi-stack high-density InAs QDMs into the heterostructure of GaAlAs/GaAs solar cells as shown in the schematic structure of figure 3[2].

experiment. The dot density in a single stack is \(10^{12}\) cm\({}^{2}\). Therefore, the dot volume of 5 stack InAs QDMs is as great as \(10^{17}\)-\(10^{18}\) cm\({}^{-3}\) which is dense enough for effective PV performance. We believe that small stack number but high dot density per each single stack is preferable for good dot uniformity which is requisite for intermediate band theory. Too many stacks of QDMs would lead to low dot quality and uniformity as well as too deep junction. The junction depth of this GaAs based solar cell should be kept at 0.5 m due to high absorption coefficient of this direct gap semiconductor material.

Further improvement of InAs QDM solar cells could be done by additional AR coating and mesa-etching to avoid light reflection and leakage current of solar cells. Finer grid pattern of front contact of InAs QDM solar cells is also important for their operation at high concentrated sunlight.

## VI Conclusion

Multi-stack high-density InAs quantum dot molecule solar cells are fabricated and tested. A typical cell gives high energy conversion efficiency of 25.9 % under 100 mW/cm\({}^{2}\) AM1 solar simulator. This nanostructure solar cell has good performance at high concentration sunlight due to the zero dimensionality of quantum dots. Optimum design of QDM solar cell structure such as capping material, number of stacks, depth of active QDM layers, additional anti-reflection coating, fine structure of grid contact, etc., is under investigation in order to achieve for higher efficiency QDM solar cells.
