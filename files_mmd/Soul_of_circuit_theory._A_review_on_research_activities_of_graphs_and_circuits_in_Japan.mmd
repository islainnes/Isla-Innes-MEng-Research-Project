[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:1]

In the 1970's, since the scope of circuit theory had expanded, the IEEE Circuit Theory Group has changed its name to IEEE Circuits and Systems Society. However, what changed essentially was the component-technology and _the essential soul of circuit theory_ as the system-technology has been still consistent. Yes, the _soul of circuit theory is the spirit of challenge with the power of system-technology against the most important difficulty, with which industry is confronted_.

The fundamental concept of circuit theory is to study not the characteristics of individual elements but the nature of overall structure of a system which leads us to graph theory. Since Kirchhoff's pioneering studies in 1845 [1] and 1847 [2], graph concept has been an essential philosophy throughout the world. Even in Japan, as Watanabe reported briefly in the Special Centennial CAS Issue [4], graph theory has been actively studied and many significant contributions have been made. These activities indicate that the _soul of circuit theory_ is still healthy enough and will be alive forever. This paper intends to survey research activities in the area of topological aspects of circuit theory in Japan, most of which have been done after the previous report [4], and to present main results obtained by Japanese circuit theorists. It is, however, far beyond the authors' capabilities to cover all of the contributions. Therefore, the selection of topics and its description in this paper are, rather, due to the authors' subjective points of view.

## II Definitions of Basic Graph-Theoretic Term

First of all, definitions of basic graph-theoretic terms needed in the description of this paper are introduced. For most of them, however, the readers are requested to refer to those in [5]. The term of _graph_ is used as the concept of "directed graph" defined in [5], and the term of _node_ as the concept of "vertex" in [5]. Also, the term of _loop_ here is used as "circuit" in [5] because the term of circuit stands often for the concept of "electrical circuit" in circuit theory. Let us consider a graph \(G\) with node set \(V=V(G)\) and edge set \(E=E(G)\). The number of nodes (respectively, edges) of \(G\) is denoted by \(|V|\) (respectively, \(|E|\)). With each edge of \(G\) is associated an ordered pair of nodes. If an edge \(c_{k}\) is represented as of \(c_{k}=(v_{a},v_{b})\) for certain nodes \(v_{a}\) and \(v_{b}\), the nodes \(v_{a}\) and \(v_{b}\) are called the end nodes of the edge \(c_{k}\), \(v_{a}\) being called the initial node and \(v_{b}\) the terminal node of \(c_{k}\). In the pictorial representation of \(G\), a node is represented by a small circle and an edge is represented by a line segment connecting the small circles that represent the end nodes of the edge. Each edge is assigned an orientation indicated by an arrow which is drawn from the initial to the terminal node. A tree of \(G\) means a spanning tree defined in [5], i.e. a maximal set of edges not containing any loop. Let \(T\) be a tree of \(G\), The edges contained in \(T\) are called the _branches_ of \(T\), and the edges not contained in \(T\) the _chords_ of \(T\). The set of all the chords of \(T\), denoted by \(\overline{T}=E-T\) is called the _cotree_ of \(T\). The number of connected components of \(G\) is denoted by \(\gamma=\gamma(G)\), and the number of branches (respectively, chords) of \(T\) is denoted by \(\rho=\rho(G)\) (respectively, \(\mu=\mu(G)\)) where \(\rho=|V|-\gamma\) and \(\rho+\mu=|E|\). Such numbers \(\rho\) and \(\mu\) are called the rank and the nullity of \(G\), respectively. For a tree \(T\) of \(G\), if a loop of \(G\) contains one chord, say \(c\), of \(T\) but not any other chords of \(T\), the loop is called the _fundamental loop_ defined by \(c\), with respect to \(T\) of \(G\). For a tree \(T\) of \(G\), dually, if a cutset of \(G\) contains one branch, say \(b\), of \(T\) but not any other branches of \(T\), the cutset is called the _fundamental cutset_ defined by \(b\) with respect to \(T\) of \(G\). The number of all the fundamental loops (respectively, cutsets) with respect to \(T\) of \(G\) is equal to the nullity \(\mu\) (respectively, rank \(\rho\)) of \(G\), and the set of such loops (respectively, cutsets) is called a _fundamental system of loops_ (respectively, _cutsets_) of \(G\). For two trees \(T_{1}\) and \(T_{2}\) of \(G\), the number of edges which are present in \(T_{1}\) (respectively, \(T_{2}\)) and not in \(T_{2}\) (respectively, \(T_{1}\)), denoted by

\[d(T_{1},T_{2})=[T_{1}-T_{2}]=[T_{2}-T_{1}],\]

is called the _distance_ between \(T_{1}\) and \(T_{2}\) of \(G\). Then,

\[d(T_{1},T_{2})=\rho-[T_{1}\cap T_{2}]=\mu-|\overline{T_{1}}\cap\overline{T_{2}}|.\]

Elements in \(T_{1}\cap T_{2}\) are called _common branches_ of \(T_{1}\) and \(T_{2}\) of \(G\), and those in \(\overline{T_{1}}\cap\overline{T_{2}}\)_common chords_ of \(T_{1}\) and \(T_{2}\) of \(G\). Two trees \(T_{1}\) and \(T_{2}\) of \(G\) are said to be _maximally distant_ if \(d(T_{1},T_{2})\geq d(T_{1}^{\prime},T_{2}^{\prime})\) for every pair of trees \(T_{1}^{\prime}\) and \(T_{2}^{\prime}\) of \(G\). For a tree \(T\) of \(G\),

\[d(T)=\max_{T^{\prime}}\ d(T,T^{\prime})\]

(where the maximum operation is taken over all trees \(T^{\prime}\) of \(G\)) is called the _eccentricity function_ of \(T\).

\[d_{\text{track}}=\max_{T^{\prime}}\ d(T)\ \ \ \text{and}\ \ \ d_{\text{min}}=\min_{T}\ d(T)\]

(where the minimum and maximum operations are taken over all trees \(T\) of \(G\)) are the _diameter_ and the _radius_, respectively, of the tree set of \(G\). A tree \(T\) satisfying \(d(T)=d_{\text{track}}\) of \(G\) is called a _peripheral tree_ of \(G\), and a tree \(T\) satisfying \(d(T)=d_{\text{min}}\) of \(G\) is called a _central tree_ of \(G\). The importance of these two trees is shown in what follows.

A linear time-invariant electrical circuit whose topology is given by a graph \(G\) is denoted by \(N_{G}\) or the same symbol \(G\). With each edge in \(N_{G}\), two electrical variables called "voltage" and "current" of the edge are associated. Since the two variables are functions of time and may take on positive and negative values in the course of time, reference directions for them are specified. An arrow, called "orientation", assigned to each edge of \(N_{G}\) indicate the reference direction in the meaning that the current of the edge is positive whenever it is in the direction of the arrow and, at the same time, that the voltage of the edge is positive whenever it drops in the direction of the arrow. Unless otherwise stated, it is assumed that any edges are not made up of independent voltage and/or current sources only. This assumption is always admissible with the use of Blakely's transformation (i.e., \(\upsilon\)-shift) of voltage sources or its dual. The physical nature of \(N_{G}\) is expressed as linear equations with respect to the voltages and currents of the edges of \(N_{G}\) and are called the _edge_\(\upsilon\)-\(i\)_characteristics_ of \(N_{G}\). An edge of \(N_{G}\) is called an _impedance-edge_ if the edge \(\upsilon\)-\(i\) characteristic is represented as the form of \(v=\), and an _admittance-edge_ if the edge \(\upsilon\)-\(i\) characteristic is represented as the form of \(i=\). With respect to a tree of \(N_{G}\), a branch (respectively, chord) being an impedance-edge is called an _impedance-branch_ (respectively, _impedance-chord_), and a branch (respectively, chord) being an admittance-edge an _admittance-branch_ (respectively, _admittance-chord_). Equations which arise from an application of Kirchhoff's current (respectively, voltage) law to a fundamental system of cutsets (respectively, loops) of \(G\), in \(N_{G}\), are called a _fundamental system of KCL_ (respectively, \(KVL\)) _equations_ of \(N_{G}\). They are expressed as linear equations with respect to edge-currents (respectively, edge-voltages) of \(N_{G}\), and they depend only on the topology of \(N_{G}\) (i.e., \(G\)) and not on the edge \(\nu\)-\(i\) characteristics of \(N_{G}\). Such a fundamental system of KCL (respectively, KVL) equations of \(N_{G}\) represents a system of linearly independent KCL (respectively, KVL) equations of \(N_{G}\). The number of linearly independent KCL (respectively, KVL) equations of \(N_{G}\) is equal to \(\rho\) (respectively, \(\mu\)), \(\rho+\mu\) being equal to \(|\!|\!|E|\). The number of the \(\upsilon\)-\(i\) characteristics of the edges of \(N_{G}\) is \(|\!|\!|E|\). As is well known, a system of \(2|\!|\!|E|\) equations, made up of a fundamental system of KCL equations, a fundamental system of KVL equations and the edge \(\upsilon\)-\(i\) characteristics of \(N_{G}\), constitutes the complete set of circuit equations required to describe \(N_{G}\).

## III A Firm Foundation for Succeeding

"Graph Theory Era" in Japan

In 1847, G. Kirchhoff [2] introduced some topological concepts including a concept equivalent to "tree" in order to formulate a system of circuit equations and to characterize the solution of the system. As was pointed out by S. Darlington [3], a substantial interest in topological aspects of circuit theory started around the mid-1930's. R. M. Foster [6] was an early enthusiast who took interest in topological aspects of circuit theory. Stimulated by Foster, H. Whitney [7] gave the famous theorem on "2-isomorphic graphs" which should be called the "Foster-Whitney theorem" nowadays. W. Cauer as well emphasized in his famous book the importance of topological aspects of circuits. Stimulated by Cauer's contributions, S. Okada first introduced the topological formulation and analysis of electrical circuits to electrical engineers in Japan and laid a solid foundation of topological circuit analysis based on his own philosophy in his series of papers [8] in the early 1940's. Since the early 1950's, aiming at unifying study on basic problems in engineering sciences by means of geometry, K. Kondo, S. Okada, R. Onodera, H. Orui, M. Iri, and S. Amari [9, 10, 11, 12] did extensive research work on network topology based on the topological geometry and algebra, where the term of _network topology_ was used in the sense of "topology of circuit interconnections." Using "tensor notation" in expression of equations, they built up a firm foundation for succeeding "graph theory era" in Japan.

## IV Graph Realization Problem

During about ten years from the late 1950's, one of the hot research topics in the field of network topology was the problem of checking whether or not it is possible to realize a matrix as a loop (or cutset) matrix of a graph and of giving a practical method of realizing a graph from the matrix if it is possible. This problem was called the graph realization problem. The importance of the problem was first pointed out by S. Okada [13] in 1954 as a new approach to the relay circuit theory established by A. Nakashima and M. Hanzawa [14] in 1936. The problem in the case of realizing as a loop matrix was solved by R. Gould [15], although it was incomplete from the present-day algorithmic viewpoint. The result on "minimal number of coil realization in reactance filters" [16] also provided a good example of a bridge joining graph theory and practice. The relationships of the graph realization problem to synthesis of resistive circuits and others were also recognized, and many trials to find efficient algorithms for solving the graph realization problem were made by a number of people in the world (see [17]), even in the 1960's. In 1980, as a final runner of "algorithm design race" for the graph realization problem, S. Fujishige [18] showed that an algorithmic implementation of Gould's solution by using PQ-trees [19] was "best" among the proposed ones from a viewpoint of computational complexity. The dual form of Gould's idea [16] was proposed without proof by S. Okada and K. Young [20] in 1961 and its validity was proved by K. P. Rajappan and A. H. Stone [21] in 1971. The graph realization problem and its best solution are recorded as the "fruit of these efforts" in the history of graph theory for circuit theory but are not utilized as a useful tool for modern technological problems yet.

## V Topological Degrees of Freedom

Another hot research topic in the field of network topology during about ten years from the late 1950's was a problem of finding efficient algorithms of generating all trees of a graph. This problem was challenged by a number of people, but it turned out, in the late 1960's, that the tree generation was not a practical means of circuit analysis. Research endeavors to the problem, however, are rewarded in that various properties of graphs have been found as by-products. One of the most remarkable by-products is the creation of new concepts of "topological degrees of freedom" and "principal partition" of a graph.

In 1967, Kishi and Kajitani concentrated themselves on studying "tree-graph," whose node corresponds to a tree of a graph and edge corresponds to a tree-pair tied together with an elementary tree transformation, and established an algorithm of finding a pair of "maximally distant trees." At the same time, H. Watanabe and T. Ohtsuki of NEC devoted themselves to the development of a CAD system and efficient circuit analysis method based on a mixed system of circuit equations that was proposed by M. Iri and S. Amari [22]. Their central concern was the lowest degrees of a mixed system of circuit equations. It was in early Summer of 1967 when Kishi's group presented their idea on maximally distant tree pair at an discussion meeting at NEC. Immediately after the meeting was over, Watanabe realized that the tree-pair concept was directly applicable to their lowest degree problem. This finding was forwarded to Kishi and Iri without delay. Then three groups separately succeeded their research on the respective problems of "principal partition" of a graph, "topological degrees of freedom" of circuit analysis and its linear algebraic version. The problem of finding a pair of maximally distant trees was already presented in Ore's book [23] at that time and it was solved at almost the same time in a different manner by G. Baron and W. Imrich [24]. However, Baron and Imrich did not notice the same concept as the principal partition of a graph. Kishi, Kajitani, Ohtsuki, Watanabe, and Iri published their results in [25, 26] and [27]. We will introduce the outline of their results by our words in what follows. A system of circuit equations in mixed analysis of electrical circuits is formulated by the following steps:

_Step 1:_ Choose a tree containing as many admittance edges as possible of \(N_{G}\), which is denoted by \(T_{\boldsymbol{y}}\). Such a tree \(T_{\boldsymbol{y}}^{\ast}\) is called a \(y\)-reference tree of \(N_{G}\).

_Step 2:_ By using all the KVL equations corresponding to fundamental loops defined by the admittance-chords with respect to \(T_{\boldsymbol{y}}\), represent all the voltages of the admittance-chords of \(T_{\boldsymbol{y}}^{\ast}\) as linear combinations of the voltages of the admittance-branches of \(T_{\boldsymbol{y}}\).

_Step 3:_ Substitute all the voltages of the admittance-chords of \(T_{\boldsymbol{y}}^{\ast}\) into the edge \(v\)-\(i\) characteristics of the admittance-edges. Then all the currents of the admittance-edges are represented as linear combinations of the voltages of the admittance-branches of \(T_{\boldsymbol{y}}^{\ast}\) and known values of voltage sources and/or current sources.

_Step 4:_ Substitute all the currents of the admittance-edges into all the KCL equations corresponding to fundamental cutsets defined by the admittance-branches with respect to \(T_{\boldsymbol{y}}^{\ast}\). Then we obtain a set of simultaneous equations with respect to both the voltages of the admittance-branches and the currents of the impedance-chords of \(T_{\boldsymbol{y}}^{\ast}\).

_Step 5:_ By using all the KCL equations corresponding to fundamental cutsets defined by the impedance-branches with respect to \(T_{\boldsymbol{y}}^{\ast}\), represent all the currents of the impedance-branches of \(T_{\boldsymbol{y}}^{\ast}\) as linear combinations of the currents of the impedance-chords of \(T_{\boldsymbol{y}}^{\ast}\).

_Step 6:_ Substitute all the currents of the impedance-branches of \(T_{\boldsymbol{y}}\) into the edge \(v\)-\(i\) characteristics of the impedance-edges. Then all the currents of the impedance-edges are represented as linear combinations of the voltages of the impedance-chords of \(T_{\boldsymbol{y}}^{\ast}\) and known values of voltage sources and/or current sources.

_Step 7:_ Substitute all the currents of the impedance-edges into all the KVL equations corresponding to fundamental loops defined by the impedance-chords with respect to \(T_{\boldsymbol{y}}\). Then we obtain another set of simultaneous equations with respect to both the voltages of the admittance-branches and the currents of the impedance-chords of \(T_{\boldsymbol{y}}^{\ast}\).

Combining two sets of simultaneous equations obtained in both Steps 4 and 7, we have a system of simultaneous equations to be solved in mixed analysis of \(N_{G}\). The mixed analysis is reduced to the loop analysis (respectively, cutset analysis) if all the edges are impedance-edges (respectively, admittance-edges). The number of variables of the system is equal to the number of the admittance-branches plus the number of impedance-chords of \(T_{\boldsymbol{y}}^{\ast}\) and is given by

\[h(E_{\boldsymbol{y}})=|T_{\boldsymbol{y}}\cap E_{\boldsymbol{y}}|+|\overline {T_{\boldsymbol{y}}}\cap E_{\boldsymbol{z}}|\]

where \(E_{\boldsymbol{y}}\) denotes the set of admittance-edges and \(E_{\boldsymbol{z}}\) the set of impedance-edges of \(N_{G}\). The number \(h(E_{\boldsymbol{y}})\) is called the _hybrid rank_ of \(N_{G}\). The hybrid rank \(h(E_{\boldsymbol{y}})\) depends not only on the topology of \(N_{G}\) but also the distribution of impedance-edges and admittance edges on \(N_{G}\). The subgraph of \(G\) obtained by removing from \(G\) all the edges in \(E_{\boldsymbol{z}}(=\boldsymbol{E}-E_{\boldsymbol{y}})\) is denoted by \(G|E_{\boldsymbol{y}}\) and the rank of \(G\underline{E}_{\boldsymbol{y}}\) is denoted by \(\rho(G|E_{\boldsymbol{y}})\). Since \(T\cap E_{\boldsymbol{y}}\) is a tree of \(G|E_{\boldsymbol{y}}\), \(\rho(G|E_{\boldsymbol{y}})=|T_{\boldsymbol{y}}\cap E_{\boldsymbol{y}}|\). Thus \(h(E_{\boldsymbol{y}})\) can be rewritten as

\[h(E_{\boldsymbol{y}})=\mu-|E_{\boldsymbol{y}}|+2\rho(G|E_{\boldsymbol{y}}).\]

The importance of the problem of obtaining a minimal hybrid rank of \(N_{G}\) was suggested by S. Amari [22]. The minimum hybrid rank of \(N_{G}\), which is taken over all partitions \((E_{\boldsymbol{y}},E_{z})\) of \(E=E(G)\), is denoted by

\[h_{\min}=\min_{E_{\boldsymbol{y}}\subset E}h(E_{\boldsymbol{y}})\]

and was called the _topological degrees of freedom_ of \(N_{G}\) by Ohtsuki, Ishizaki, and Watanabe [26]. We call \(E_{\boldsymbol{y}}\) satisfying \(h(E_{\boldsymbol{y}})=h_{\min}\) a _critical set_ of \(G\). It is proved that if \(E_{\boldsymbol{y}}^{\ast}\) and \(E_{\boldsymbol{y}}^{\ast}\) are critical sets of \(G\), then \(E_{\boldsymbol{y}}^{\ast}\cup E_{\boldsymbol{y}}^{\ast}\) and \(E_{\boldsymbol{y}}^{\ast}\cap E_{\boldsymbol{y}}^{\ast}\) are also critical sets of \(G\). Therefore, the family of all the critical sets of \(G\) forms a distributive lattice. The minimal critical set of \(G\), say \(E_{\boldsymbol{y}}^{\ast}\), is uniquely determined, and so is the maximal critical set of \(G\), say \(E_{\boldsymbol{y}}^{(\infty)}\). Any critical set \(E_{\boldsymbol{y}}\) of satisfies \(E_{\boldsymbol{y}}^{(0)}\subseteq E_{\boldsymbol{y}}\subseteq E_{\boldsymbol{y} }^{(\infty)}\), A unique tri-partition \((E_{\boldsymbol{y}}^{+},c_{\boldsymbol{y}}^{0},E_{\boldsymbol{y}}^{\ast})\) defined by

\[E_{\boldsymbol{y}}^{+}=E_{\boldsymbol{y}}^{(0)},\quad E_{\boldsymbol{y}}^{0}=E_ {\boldsymbol{y}}^{(\infty)}-E_{\boldsymbol{y}}^{(0)},\quad E_{\boldsymbol{y}}^{ \ast}=E-E_{\boldsymbol{y}}^{(\infty)}\]

is called the _principal partition_ of \(G\). This partition was created by Kishi and Y. Kajitani from a somewhat different point of view [25, 26]. They created it when they gave an algorithm of finding a pair of maximally distant trees of a graph. For a subset \(E_{\boldsymbol{y}}\) of the edge set \(E\) of \(G\), as already defined, \(T_{\boldsymbol{y}}\) is a tree containing as many edges of the subset \(E_{\boldsymbol{y}}\) as possible of \(G\) and satisfies

\[|T_{\boldsymbol{1}}\cap E_{\boldsymbol{y}}|\leq |T_{\boldsymbol{y}}\cap E_{\boldsymbol{y}}|=\rho(G|E_{\boldsymbol{y}})\] \[|T_{\boldsymbol{2}}\cap E_{\boldsymbol{y}}|\leq |T_{\boldsymbol{y}}\cap E_{\boldsymbol{y}}|=\rho(G|E_{\boldsymbol{y}})\]

for any two trees \(T_{\boldsymbol{1}}\) and \(T_{\boldsymbol{2}}\) of \(G\). Taking account of this fact, we have

\[h(E_{\boldsymbol{y}}) = \mu-|E_{\boldsymbol{y}}|+2\rho(G|E_{\boldsymbol{y}})\] \[\geq\mu-|E_{\boldsymbol{y}}|+|T_{\boldsymbol{1}}\cap E_{ \boldsymbol{y}}|+|T_{\boldsymbol{2}}\cap E_{\boldsymbol{y}}|\] \[\geq\mu-|E_{\boldsymbol{y}}|+|T_{\boldsymbol{1}}\cup T_{ \boldsymbol{2}}\rangle\cap E_{\boldsymbol{y}}|\] \[= \mu-|(\overline{T_{\boldsymbol{1}}}\cap\overline{T_{is satisfied if and only if

1. \(\overline{T_{1}}\cap\overline{T_{2}}\subseteq E_{y}\),
2. \(T_{1}\cap E_{y}\) and \(T_{2}\cap E_{y}\) have no common branches.
3. \(T_{1}\cap E_{y}\) and \(T_{2}\cap E_{y}\) are trees of \(G|E_{y}\).

Thus, we see that the topological degrees of freedom of \(G\) are equal to \(d_{\text{max}}\). Trees \(T_{1}\) and \(T_{2}\) of satisfying the conditions a), b), and c) are a pair of maximally distant trees of \(G\), and \(E_{y}\) satisfying the conditions a), b), and c) is a critical set of \(G\). For a critical set \(E_{y}\) of \(G\), a certain (i.e., not always every) tree \(T_{y}\) containing as many edges of the subset \(E_{y}\) as possible of \(G\) satisfies \(d(T_{y})=d_{\text{max}}\) and is nothing but a peripheral tree of \(G\). Such a tree is one of a maximally distant tree pair of \(G\) and was called an _extremal tree_ by Ohtsuki, Ishizaki, and Watanabe [26]. They solved the problem of determining the topological degrees of freedom of \(G\) by designing an algorithm of finding a critical set and an extremal tree of \(G_{\star}\)

In fact, the creation of the concepts of the topological degrees of freedom and the principal partition, which was done in Japan, was one of the exciting events in the history of graph theory for circuit theory. The papers [25] and [26] implicitly involved an idea to create a concept of "prime CTS-minors." Indeed, this concept was created in 1970. For two subsets \(E^{\prime}\) and \(E^{\prime\prime}\) satisfying \(E^{\prime}\subset E^{\prime\prime}\subseteq E\) of \(G\), the graph obtained from \(G|E^{\prime\prime}\) by contraction of all edges in \(E^{\prime}\) is denoted by \((G|E^{\prime\prime})\times(E^{\prime\prime}-E^{\prime})\), and its rank is denoted by \(\rho((G|E^{\prime\prime})\times(E^{\prime\prime}-E^{\prime}))\). Then, we can see that, for any two critical sets \(E^{\prime}_{y}\) and \(E^{\prime\prime}_{y}\) satisfying \(E^{\prime}_{y}\subset E^{\prime\prime}_{y}\subseteq E\) and for a pair of maximally distant trees \(T_{1}\) and \(T_{2}\) of \(G\):

1. \(T_{1}\cap(E^{\prime\prime}_{y}-E^{\prime}_{y})\) and \(T_{2}\cap(E^{\prime\prime}_{y}-E^{\prime}_{y})\) are two trees of \((G|E^{\prime\prime}_{y})\times(E^{\prime\prime}_{y}-E^{\prime}_{y})\);
2. one of the two trees is a cotree of the other.

Such a graph \((G|E^{\prime\prime}_{y})\times(E^{\prime\prime}_{y}-E^{\prime}_{y})\) is called a _minor with complementary tree structure_ (abbreviated to a _CTS-minor_ in this paper) of \(G\). Such a CTS-minor was called an irreducible minor with complementary tree structure in [28]. For any two critical sets \(E^{\prime}_{y}\) and \(E^{\prime\prime}_{y}\) satisfying \(E^{\prime}_{y}\subset E^{\prime\prime}_{y}\subseteq E\), if there is no critical set \(E_{y}\) satisfying \(E^{\prime}_{y}\subset E_{y}\subseteq E^{\prime\prime}_{y}\), the graph \((G|E^{\prime\prime}_{y})\times(E^{\prime\prime}_{y}-E^{\prime}_{y})\) is called a _prime CTS-minor_ of \(G\). Such a prime CTS-minor was called a strongly irreducible minor with complementary tree structure in [28]. Historically, it should be noted that the concept of a graph with complementary tree structure (abbreviated to CTS-graph in this paper), per se, was introduced by H. B. Lee [29] in 1961 in relation to designing _RL_ circuits. In 1970, decomposition of a CTS-graph into its prime CTS-minors was clarified by Y. Kajitani [30] and T. Ozawa [31], independently. In 1971, independently of them, the same result as well as its linear algebraic version was given by M. Iri [32]. Recently, in [33], a problem of characterizing the class of CTS-graphs was completely solved by proving that _every prime CTS-graph except a loop with two edges is a wheel with four nodes or can be generated from the wheel by repeated applications of simple operations of two types_. This result is noteworthy especially in relation to design of reliable communication networks.

Hereafter, we call Kishi and Kajitani's principal partition the _Kishi-Kajitani partition_. In 1971, J. Bruno and L. Weinberg [34] pointed out that the Kishi and Kajitani partition gives an expression of the complete solution of the Shannon switching game which was already solved in an algorithmic manner by Lehman in 1965, and also extended the concept of the Kishi and Kajitani partition to a concept in the case of matroids. The concept was further generalized independently by H. Narayanan [35] in 1974 and N. Tomizawa [28] in 1976. The resulting partition is called the _Narayanan-Tomizawa partition_ (mentioned in the following chapter). A tree contained commonly in two graphs with the same edge set is called a _common tree_ of the two graphs. A circuit is said to be _solvable_ if a system of circuit equations required to describe the circuit can be uniquely solved. A necessary and sufficient topological condition for an active circuit containing neither ideal transformers nor ideal gyrators to be solvable is that there should exist a common tree in two graphs associated with the circuit. T. Ozawa [36] gave the complete solution of a problem of checking whether or not at least one common tree in two graphs exists, by introducing a concept of "principal partition of two graphs". M. Iri and N. Tomizawa [37] provided the result equivalent to Ozawa's, independently. They proved that for two graphs \(G_{i}\) and \(G_{v}\) with the same edge set a problem of finding a pair of a tree \(T_{i}\) of \(G_{i}\) and a tree \(T_{v}\) of \(G_{v}\) such that \(T_{i}\) and \(T_{v}\) contain as many common edges as possible is matroid-theoretically equivalent to the problem of finding the pair of maximally distant trees of a single graph. This idea was based on J. Edomonds [38]. Ozawa's principal partition can be naturally obtained from Iri and Tomizawa's view-point. In [39], a new approach to the Kishi-Kajitani partition was proposed by introducing new concepts of _covering tree, B-covering tree and Q-covering tree_. The Kishi-Kajitani partition was further generalized or extended in several directions [40, 41, 42]. One of the most remarkable applications of the generalized partitions was provided by K. Murota, M. Iri, and M. Nakamura [43]. They proposed an efficient method of solving systems of linear/nonlinear equations. Interpreting their method from the standpoint of circuit analysis of \(N_{G}\), their method is regarded as a tabular method, in which the finest principal partition [32, 42] of the coefficient matrix of a system of \(2|E|\) equations required to describe \(N_{G}\) is effectively used. Here, the coefficient matrix consists of two submatrices: one being related to the topology of the circuit and the other to the edge \(v\)-\(i\) characteristics of \(N_{G_{\star}}\). Their method involves a sparse matrix technique, which is a tool of speeding up the computational time and reducing the memory size. This is a generalization of the mixed analysis method in [26]. Although SPICE and its improved versions are very popular as circuit simulators in the world nowadays, a new simulator in which their method will be implemented may be more promising.

## VI Second Topological Degrees of Freedom

Another exciting event in graph theory for circuit theory was the creation of "second topological degrees of freedom" of a graph. Using Mayeda's two-graph model [44] of circuits, Y. Kajitani, T. Kawamoto, and S. Shinoda [45] proposed a new method of circuit analysis, called "primal-dual method," and introduced the concept of "second topological degrees of freedom" in relation to the minimum dimension for a system of simultaneous equations to be solved for the primal-dual method. To state the second topological degrees of freedom somewhat in detail, we will outline the primal-dual method using a single graph model. For convenience' sake of description, we consider a circuit \(N_{G}\) whose topology is a graph \(G\) and assume that, for a tree \(T\) of \(G\), the branches (respectively, chords) on \(N_{G}\) can be regarded as impedance-edges (respectively, admittance-edges), and that there are not mutual couplings from the branches to the chords of \(T\) on \(N_{G}\). The primal-dual method using a single graph model is formulated as follows:

**Step 1**: _For the tree \(T\) of \(G\), choose a tree \(T_{*}\) of \(G[\overline{T}\), where \(G[\overline{T}\) is the subgraph of \(G\) obtained from \(G\) by removing all the edges of \(T\)._

**Step 2**: _Using KVL equations on \(N_{G}\) corresponding to fundamental loops defined by chords of \(T_{*}\) (i.e., edges in \(\overline{T}_{*}=\overline{T}-T_{*}\)) with respect to \(T_{*}\) on \(G[\overline{T}]\), represent all the voltages of the chords of \(T_{*}\) on \(N_{G}\) as linear combinations of the voltages of the branches of \(T_{*}\) on \(N_{G}\)._

**Step 3**: _Substitute all the voltages of the chords of \(T_{*}\) on \(N_{G}\) into the edge \(v\)-\(i\) characteristics of the chords of \(T\). Then, from the assumption on the representation of edge \(v\)-\(i\) characteristics, all the currents of the chords of \(T\) on \(N_{G}\) are represented as linear combinations of the voltages of the branches of \(T_{*}\) on \(N_{G}\) and known values of voltage sources and/or current sources._

**Step 4**: _Substitute all the currents of the edges on \(N_{G}\) into \(N_{G}\) into all the KCL equations on \(N_{G}\) corresponding to fundamental cutsets defined by the branches of \(T\) with respect to \(T\) of \(G\). Then all the currents of the branches of \(T\) on \(N_{G}\) are represented as linear combinations of the voltages of the branches of \(T_{*}\) on \(N_{G}\) and known values of voltage sources and/or current sources._

**Step 5**: _Substitute all the currents of the edges on \(N_{G}\) into the edge \(v\)-\(i\) characteristics of the branches of \(T\). Then all the voltages of the branches of \(T\) on \(N_{G}\) as linear combinations of the voltages of the branches of \(T_{*}\) on \(N_{G}\) and known values of voltage sources and/or current sources._

**Step 6**: _Substitute all the voltages of the branches of \(T\) on \(N_{G}\) into all the KVL equations on \(N_{G}\) corresponding to fundamental loops defined by edges of \(\overline{T}\cap T_{*}\) with respect to \(T\) of \(G\). Then we obtain a set of simultaneous equations with respect to the voltages of the branches of \(T_{*}\) (i.e., edges of \(\overline{T}\cap T_{*}\)) on \(N_{G}\)._

**Step 7**: _The set of simultaneous equations obtained in Step 6 is a system of simultaneous equations to be solved in primal-dual analysis of \(N_{G}\). The number of variables of the system is the number of the branches of \(T_{*}\) (i.e., edges of \(\overline{T}\cap T_{*}\)) of \(G\), and is given by_

\[h^{(2)}(T)=[\overline{T}\cap T_{*}]=\rho(G[\overline{T}).\]

_This number \(h^{(2)}(T)\) is called the 2nd hybrid rank of \(N_{G}\). The 2nd hybrid rank \(h^{(2)}(T)\) depends on a tree \(T\) of \(N_{G}\). Now, considering that the eccentricity function \(d(T)\) of \(T\) is expressed as_

\[d(T)=\mu-\min_{\overline{T}^{\prime}}[\overline{T}\cap\overline{T^{\prime}}] =\rho(G[\overline{T})\]

_we have \(h^{(2)}(T)=d(T)\). Since \(d(T)\) satisfies_

\[d_{min}\leq d(T)\leq d_{\text{max}}\]

\(h^{(2)}\) takes the minimum value \(d_{\text{min}}\) when \(T\) is a central tree of \(G\). The minimum 2nd hybrid rank of \(N_{G}\) in this sense, which can always be achieved whenever \(T\) is chosen as a central tree of \(G\), is called the _second topological degrees of freedom_ of \(N_{G^{*}}\). Here, one of the remarkable points is that any 2nd hybrid rank of \(N_{G}\) is less than or equal to the topological degrees of freedom, as is clear from the inequality of \(d_{\text{min}}\leq d(T)\leq d_{\text{max}}\). The number of the topological degrees of freedom of \(G\) is equal to the diameter of the tree set of \(G\), while the number of the second topological degrees of freedom of \(G\) is equal to the radius of the tree set of \(G\). Thus, the second topological degrees of freedom are always less than or equal to the topological degrees of freedom in number. For example, consider as \(G\) a complete graph \(K_{4}\) of four nodes, then the number of its topological degrees of freedom is 3, but the number of its 2nd topological degrees of freedom is 2. When numerically solving a system of simultaneous equations, generally speaking, the less the dimension of the system is, the speedier the system is solved. In this sense, the primal-dual method is preferable to the mixed analysis.

In each of the said steps, dually replacing tree with cotree, cotree with tree, branches with chords, chords with branches, currents with voltages, voltages with currents, KCL with KVL, KVL, and so on, we can obtain another system of simultaneous equations to be solved in primal-dual analysis. The number of variables of the system, called "second hybrid rank" as well, is equal to the nullity of the graph obtained from \(G\) by contraction of all the edges of the cotree of a chosen tree of \(G\). The resulting graph is denoted by \(G\times T\) for the chosen tree \(T\) of \(G\), and its nullity is denoted by \(\mu(G\times T)\). This nullity is proved to be equal to \(d(T)\), and the same results as stated above are obtained as well.

In order to obtain the second topological degrees of freedom of a graph, we have to find a central tree of the graph. The concept of a central tree, per se, was first introduced by N. Deo [46] in 1966, but no polynomial time algorithm of finding a central tree of any given graph has been known until now. In [45], research results on central trees, which had been done until that time, were surveyed. In [47], invariance property of central trees was investigated. In [48], relationships between a central tree and the Kishi-Kajitani partition of a graph were studied by introducing a concept of "eccentricity of tree set" of a graph \(G\), defined by

\[\delta=(d_{\text{max}}\boldsymbol{\text{-}}\,d_{\text{min}})/d_{\text{max}}.\]

As is clear from the definition of \(\delta\), any tree of \(G\) is a central tree of \(G\) if and only if \(\delta=\boldsymbol{\text{0}}\). In [48], it was proved that \(\delta=\boldsymbol{\text{0}}\) if and only if either any cutset of \(G\) contains a loop of \(G\) or any loop of \(G\) contains a cutset of \(G\), and also it was proved that \(\delta=\boldsymbol{\text{1}}/\boldsymbol{\text{2}}\) if and only if there exists a critical set \(S\) of \(G\) such that \(E-S\) is a central tree of \(G\). In [49], it was proved that an incidence set of a node \(v\), say \(I(v)\), of \(G\) is a central tree of \(G\) if 1) \(I(v)\) is a tree of \(G\), 2) the graph obtained

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:7]

is a central tree of \(G\), where \(d_{\text{min}}=\rho(G|T)=4\). It should be noted that \(G\) in this example has 11 central trees, which can be obtained as of \((E-S_{\alpha_{1}})\,\cup\,H=\{1,2,3,4,5\}\,\cup\,H\) for each tree \(H\) of \(G\times S_{\alpha_{1}}\) shown in Fig. 2.

## VII Circuit Solvability Problem

A circuit is solvable if and only if a system of equations describing the circuit can be uniquely solved. A problem of checking whether or not a circuit is solvable is called the _solvability problem_ of the circuit. This problem is one of the most fundamental problems in circuit theory. S. Seshu and M.B. Reed [51] established a necessary and sufficient condition for a linear _RLC_ circuit containing independent sources to be solvable. Using their basic approach, several circuit theorists subsequently discussed the solvability problem for more general classes of circuits. A necessary and sufficient topological condition for a linear active circuit containing neither ideal transformers nor ideal gyrators to be uniquely solvable is that there should exist at least one common tree in two graphs associated with the circuit. T. Ozawa [36] and M. Iri and N. Tomizawa [37], independently, in 1974 gave the complete solution of a problem of checking whether or not a common tree exists in two graphs. Ideal transformers and ideal gyrators are circuit elements whose element values satisfy particularly specified relationships. A circuit is called an _RLCT circuit_ if it is made up of resistors, inductors, capacitors and ideal transformers. The solvability problem of a linear RLCT circuit, together with its state-variable selection problem, was first formulated and completely solved by E. S. Kuh, D. Layton, and J. Tow [52] in 1968. Here the state-variable selection problem of a circuit is how to select the state-variables in the circuit. A circuit is called an _RCG circuit_ if it is made up of resistors, capacitors and ideal gyrators. In 1974, both the solvability problem and the state-variable selection problem of a linear RCG circuit were first formulated by M. Milic [53]. The formulation was a problem of finding a common tree satisfying a special property in two graphs associated with the circuit. In 1980, A. Recski had a thought that Milic's solvability problem could be solved by his algorithm [54]. However, in 1985, S. Ueno and Y. Kajitani [55] showed that Recski's thought was wrong, and succeeded in solving both of Milic's problems by defining a concept of "augmenting path" and by means of repeatedly solving a parity problem. It should be remarked that M. Stallmann and H. N. Gabow [56] defined the same concept of an augmenting path as Ueno and Kajitani's, independently, and designed an efficient algorithm for solving a parity problem of linear matroids (including graphs). Since a linear RCG circuit is a general circuit model, which is electrically equivalent to any types of linear circuits, we see here that necessary and sufficient topological conditions for all kinds of linear circuits have been furnished. The results are now recorded in the history of graph theory for circuit theory.

## VIII Element-Value Determinability

Another topic in graph theory for circuit theory is concerned with the problem of diagnosis of faulty elements in an analog circuit. The problem of diagnosis has been of great interest to researchers in the fields of circuits and systems, with high development of modern integrated circuit technology of analog circuits not only with great complexity but also with circuit elements being inaccessibly embedded within circuit chips. The faults of an analog circuit are considered to be caused mainly when the actual values of the circuit elements deviate from the respective design values beyond the respective design tolerance margins. The faults are classified into two kinds: catastrophic faults and deviation faults. The catastrophic faults could be caused when at least one of the circuit elements is either short-circuited or open-circuited, when at least two nodes are short-circuited or when at least one node is split into two or more nodes. On the other hand, the deviation faults could be caused when an element-value deviates from its design value without reaching its extreme lower or upper bounds. A mathematical formulation of the problem of diagnosis of catastrophic faults in a circuit is, in general, difficult because the faults break the topology of the circuit. A fault dictionary technique is a very promising approach to diagnosis of catastrophic faults, but it is very hard to construct a good fault dictionary. The deviation faults could result from manufacturing tolerances, aging, or parasitic effects. Practically, simultaneous changes in several element-values occur. A problem of diagnosis of deviation faults of a circuit is easily formulated because the topology of the circuit can be assumed to remain unchanged for deviation faults. Of significant importance in relation to such deviation faults _is to check whether or not it is possible to uniquely determine the element-values in a circuit from node-voltage measurements at its accessible nodes, under the assumption that: 1) the circuit is of known topology (and of known element-kinds if possible) and 2) the actual value of each element-value of the circuit almost always deviates from the design value and is not known exactly_. This problem is called the _element-value determinability problem_. Also, for a circuit which is element-value determinable, a method for actual computation of its element-values is called an _element-value calculation technique_. The element-value determinability problem of a linear _RLC_ circuit, together with its element-value calculation techniques, was considered by R. S. Berkowitz [57] in 1962. He gave a formulation of the problem and showed some necessary conditions and sufficient conditions for the element-value determinability. Subsequently, a number of trials to seek a necessary and sufficient condition for the element-value determinability were made. However, _most of them are_not promising, because they are proposed on an impractical assumption that the actual values of the good circuit elements are exactly on the respective design values._ One remarkable result is that of N. Navid and A. Willson, Jr. In [58] they proposed sufficient algebraic and topological conditions for the element-value determinability of a linear resistive circuit with internal nodes from a standpoint of directly solving, by Newton-Raphson method, a system of nonlinear equations with respect to element-values. Another remarkable result was given in a series of the references of [59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65]. It is based upon an equivalent circuit transformation with the repeated use of generalized star to polygon transformations and its inverse. The first contribution to this result was made by S. Even and A. Lempel [66] in 1967, based upon Wang and Tokad's condition [67] (or Bedrosian's [68]) for the converse of a generalized star to polygon transformation of an _RLC_ circuit. An alternative approach to Even and Lempel's contribution was made in [59] in 1978 and in [60] in 1979. The approach led us to a linear element-value calculation technique, which involves only the solution of a system of linear equations, for determining the element-values of a linear resistive circuit with inaccessible nodes from the node-voltage measurements. The approach was applied to active circuits [61], and furthermore it was extended extensively in [62, 63, 64, 65], in which graph-theoretic concepts called _dendroid_ and _dendroidal graph_ play important roles. A concept of _dendroid_ of a graph is the graph's subgraph \(H\) such that: 1) \(H\) has the same node set as the graph and 2) each of components of \(H\) contains exactly one loop with an odd number of edges (greater than or equal to three). A graph, with each node of which a complex number is associated, is said to be _dendroidal_ if either 1) it has a connected dendroid or 2) it has a disconnected dendroid such that the signs of the real and imaginary parts of a complex number associated with a certain node of each component are known. For the detailed survey about the theory of element-value determinability, [69] should be referred to. It is interesting that [69] shows, as an example, two circuits which can be judged to be element-value determinable by a method in [64] but cannot be judged to be so by that of Navid and Willson, Jr. [58]. Graph-theoretical approaches are very useful for developing a publicly available user-oriented analog circuit diagnosis system.

## IX Location on Networks

Flows and tensions are the abstract concepts of currents and voltages, respectively. Kirchhoff's laws on currents and voltages have been conceptually extended to the conservation of flows and the equilibrium law of tensions, and the theory of flows and tensions of networks has been largely developed since the famous book of Ford and Fulkerson [70]. The new era of the theory of flow and/or tension networks has been opened up. In there, the _soul of circuit theory_ plays a backbone's role. Until now, efficient algorithms of finding _shortest paths_, _minimal trees_, _maximal flows_ and _minimum cost flows_ have been extensively developed. They have been applied to various basic problems in various fields including VLSI circuit design technologies, computer networks, communication networks, and road networks. Nowadays, problems of selecting the optimal location for facilities on networks are of interest to us. The problems are called _location problems_. Examples of facilities to be located are batteries (i.e. power line layout) on printed circuit boards, information service centers on a communication network, data stations of files on a computer network, and gas stations, fire stations, post offices, schools, banks and/or stores on a road network. The location problems are classified according to types of criteria. Facilities are located on "nodes" or on "points on edges" in networks. By what measure the optimal points for facilities to be located in a network are determined? Which point is optimal or more central than any other points for facilities in a network? The most important issue raised in the process of solving location problems is the selection of suitable optimality criterion, or objective function. This leads us to the study of functions measuring the degree of optimality or centrality, which are called _centrality functions_. Until now, many studies on the theory of centrality functions have been done. Most of the studies (for example, [71, 72, 73] and their references) are based on a standpoint of measuring the closeness between points by the distance between two points, and the rest are based on a standpoint of measuring the closeness between points by the capacity (i.e., maximum flow value) between two points. Axiomatic foundations of centrality functions of points on a metric space are proposed in [74], and a unified theory on centrality functions of points on flow and/or tension networks is given in [75]. Interesting applications of centrality functions are found in [76] and [77]. In [78], a concept of _optimal cardinality-constrained territory map_ on a tension network is introduced, and a theory and an algorithm for finding an optimal cardinality-constrained territory map on the network are given. This provides us with a useful tool for location of batteries (i.e., power line layout) on printed circuit boards. In [79], dually, a concept of _optimal cardinality-constrained territory map_ on a flow network is introduced, and a theory and an algorithm of finding an optimal cardinality-constrained territory map on the network are given. This is related to a problem of optimal distribution of information from center nodes to customer nodes. However, it should be noted that, notwithstanding a duality of the two concepts, derivation of the latter theory and algorithm is not trivial. Furthermore, in [80, 81, 82, 83, 84], several problems of location on flow networks are defined and considered as abstraction of various problems with which industry is or may be confronted in practical situations, and some remarkable results are obtained. It can be seen that researchers on these theories and algorithms are led by the _soul of circuit theory_.

## X Concluding Remarks and Discussions

In the Special CAS Issue for Centennial Celebration of IEEE published in 1984, one of the authors reported the historical review on research activities of circuit theory in Japan until the 1970's. The review [4] covered the area of circuits and systems, such as filter theory, circuit synthesis, graph theory or combinatorial mathematics, and computer-aided design for electrical circuits. The classical circuit theory, which had largely been researched and developed until the late 1970's, is one of the most integrated branches of knowledge in the theory of circuits. Nowadays, it is hardly studied in its traditional form because of the technological change from the analog to the digital. The classical circuit theory, however, has still been applied to various subjects, such as active filters, switched capacitor filters, digital filters and digital signal processors as the fundamental system theory.

In spite of abrupt change of technology, the circuit theory is best alive in the form of theory of graphs related to topological aspects of circuits. Since 1845, graph theory has played a skelton's role, as an essential concept of circuit theory in general. It has been applied to network flow and/or tension theory, in formulation of problems, in solving of the problems and/or in characterization of properties of the problems of various fields of circuits and systems. It is still being grown and applied to important problems, with which industry is confronted, as _the traditional soul of circuit theory_.

As an interesting example of generalized circuit theory, the work done by N. Nagai [85] should be mentioned, where one-dimensional Schroedinger equation is represented as an equivalent transmission-line circuit. And then, circuit theory is applied to the design problem of quantum effect devices such as resonant interband tunneling devices. It is shown that the equivalent circuit method is highly effective in analysis of quantum devices. It reminds us of the historical legend where Heaviside expressed Maxwell's equation as a telegraph equation and derived useful engineering results.

Another example of generalized circuit theory can be seen in the theory of _information networks_ proposed by H. Watanabe [86], where a complicated computer and communication system is represented as an equivalent circuit by introducing a new quantity _information vitality_ in addition to traditional information entropy. If the flow conservation law for information flows and the tension equilibrium law for information vitality are assumed, any information network can be expressed as an equivalent electric circuit and analyzed with ease.

These examples mentioned above indicate the usefulness of circuit theory beyond the traditional scope, and, here, the _soul of circuit theory_ also plays a backbone's role in constructing their theories.

Since the birth of circuit theory in 1845, graph theory as the fundamentals of circuit theory has been a rewarding experience for many contributors and has been important to the development of new techniques for solving a number of problems in the fields of circuits and systems. The situations are the same in Japan as reviewed in this paper, and we can see that the _soul of circuit theory_ has played a backbone's role throughout the history of research activities. For the limitation of space, many other important activities done in Japan, which are worthy to note, had to be excluded.

The _soul of circuit theory_ is indeed the soul of Dr. Sidney Darlington's filter design theory. We dedicate this article to his soul.
